# Possible TODOs

* Possible framing device for everything is this Georgia O'Keefe quote: “Nothing is less real than realism. Details are confusing. It is only by selection, by elimination, by emphasis, that we get at the real meaning of things.” https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/672223-nothing-is-less-real-than-realism-details-are-confusing-it
* Signal: irregular flow at certain points might indicate good point to remove cadence. Particularly around early phase/planning.
* Make it clear that the board is just a tool. It signals things to you that are valuable when it reflects the real work of the team. Those signals are ultimately from the team, not the board.
* Cadence: https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/12/teams-decouple-cadences
* Cadence of ceremonies can be a sign of immaturity. You're using time as a substitute for more directly related things. Can be useful in some/many contexts (like if you're immature as a team, or have other areas of concern), but we can look beyond it. Example: Planning. Want to decide next thing of value, come up with an experiment of how to achieve that, figure out whether it worked. Needs constrained in some way, but "two week sprint every time" is crude. What other constraints could you use? What does the board tell us?

* Playback: time to clarify thoughts to produce a quick playback session is a wonderful privilege. Being able to spend time thinking is amazing.
* Who should make changes? Who owns the board? (The whole team). Allow team to feel
 pain/discomfort. Suggest possible options, but help team own the change.
* Remember: the board represents the work. If that's not the case, change the board. Use it, then, to
drive change in the way the work works.
* Cross-functional teams: use the board to help spot teams that are multi-discipline (has dev/test/ux etc near each other but not necessarily working together), rather than cross-functional (test helps dev, dev and UX collaborate etc)
* Flow boards (scrum or kanban) are limited, homogenous forms. If you can model the work and the system together, try that. (Decision matrix. Architecture diagrams with questions/tasks.)
