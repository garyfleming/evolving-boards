# Possible TODOs

* Consider coming up with a couple of Key Points to form the structure. Might be an interesting thought exercise, at least
* Explain that WiP limits help people break silos. Forces them to move beyond "their" column and look at fixing flow across the board.
* Make it clear that flow is a linearisation of a feedback loop: https://janetgregory.ca/shift-left-why-i-dont-like-the-term/
* Make it clearer how the board **visually** signalled each issue.
* maybe describe the talk near the start as being kind of a kata and kind of a catalogue: I'll show you the moves we made when facing different situations so that you can feel the movement. It doesn't meant they're applicable in your situation, but if you can see the thinking maybe you can start to apply that.
*  Split board structure signals and work movement signals into separate halves. Use staging/movement as metaphor here.
*  midway-ish: what we’ve done to this point is flush out our rough process in terms of steps we take. We started somewhere (3-col) and iterated until we got this. Now let’s go looking for other kinds of signals
*  playback and wip blocked markers
* Staging, as in films/plays, as a metaphor for movement and placement around a board.
* What does boring look like? When is the board not telling us anything? Perfect single-piece flow, maybe, but that's unlikely. Usually telling us something. We can usually improve. Makes it somewhat harder to spot signals if there are always signals.
* Signal: irregular flow at certain points might indicate good point to remove cadence. Particularly around early phase/planning.
* Make it clear that the board is just a tool. It signals things to you that are valuable when it reflects the real work of the team. Those signals are ultimately from the team, not the board.
* Cadence: https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/12/teams-decouple-cadences
* Cadence of ceremonies can be a sign of immaturity. You're using time as a substitute for more directly related things. Can be useful in some/many contexts (like if you're immature as a team, or have other areas of concern), but we can look beyond it. Example: Planning. Want to decide next thing of value, come up with an experiment of how to achieve that, figure out whether it worked. Needs constrained in some way, but "two week sprint every time" is crude. What other constraints could you use? What does the board tell us?
* Cadence: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/944711411032297472
* More cadence: https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/944607039220830209
* Off-cadence: https://twitter.com/garyfleming/status/951599519812251650
* Cadence and time boxes: https://twitter.com/mattbarcomb/status/956650500967096320
* Playback: time to clarify thoughts to produce a quick playback session is a wonderful privilege. Being able to spend time thinking is amazing. Using that time to help the team get up to speed makes it incredibly useful and pragmatic.
* Complexity estimates: what are they? What signal?
* Cross-functional teams: use the board to help spot teams that are multi-discipline (has dev/test/ux etc near each other but not necessarily working together), rather than cross-functional (test helps dev, dev and UX collaborate etc)
* Flow boards (scrum or kanban) are limited, homogenous forms. If you can model the work and the system together, try that. (Decision matrix. Architecture diagrams with questions/tasks.)
* Jim Benson has a good quote: "How is the board telling us the truth? How is the board lying to us?". THE BOARD LIES TO US. It must be made to reflect something closer to reality, but is not itself reality. General semantics? (maybe use a picture of lying cat here) https://youtu.be/Dv1NJvZVKJU?t=4m53s
* If problems happen that aren't reflected on the board, ask yourselves why that is? Is the board missing something it should have? But remember the Georgia O'Keeffe quote.
* Retrospective coherence - Talk about memories. Your first childhood memory of going through the piazza in your red buggy. Describe details. Then reveal it's in 3rd person. Most memories are. Explain retrospective coherence. Explain how it fits with the story of the board.
* Signal: test column blocking/slow movement -> testability had plummeted when we moved a different architecture -> ensure at 3 amigos we answer "how will we test this?" and ensure appropriate affordances are in place. WARNING: it would be easy to see the bottleneck here and add more testers. Given the actual cause, that would likely make things worse.
