# Evolving Boards

A talk I first gave at Lean Agile Glasgow, in June 2017. It was written in Deckset using Markdown, with help from the Post-It Plus iOS app, to turn pictures of stickies on my office wall into something more readable.

The purpose of the talk is to help people see how we can listen for signals we're getting from our boards in order to take action, or change the board.

## Abstract

At this point in Agile's lifecycle, many teams have switched to using a Kanban Board. Some are simple, three-column trackers; others are considerably more involved. Yet, many teams don't know how to stop for a moment and _listen_ to their board. It's gently trying to nudge them about the changes that it needs to make them a better team. Come along and learn how we can go from simple to just complicated enough, smoothly.

In a new team, we started with a three-column standard to something that fits us perfectly. Our board won't work for you, but by learning how, when, and why we made our changes, you can make a board that works perfectly for your team too. See the patterns and anti-patterns; listen to the change that your board is crying out for; and enjoy the results.
