# Evolving Boards

A talk I first gave at Lean Agile Glasgow, in June 2017. It was written in Deckset using Markdown, with help from the Post-It Plus iOS app, to turn pictures of stickies on my office wall into something more readable.

The purpose of the talk is to help people see how we can listen for signals we're getting from our boards in order to take action, or change the board.
